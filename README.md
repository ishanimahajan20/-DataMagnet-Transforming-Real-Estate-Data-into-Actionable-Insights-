In this query:

We select the city and property_type columns from the Listings table to identify each property's city and property type.

We use the COUNT(*) function to count the number of properties in each city with each property type.

The result is grouped by city and property_type, allowing you to see property counts for each type in each city.

The query orders the results first by city and then by property_count in descending order. This provides a list of cities with property types sorted by the most prevalent property type within each city.

This query will help you determine which cities have the highest number of Airbnb properties and which property types are popular in each location. It's valuable for market analysis and understanding the diversity of property types available in different cities.

In this query:

We extract the month from the available_date column in the Availability table.

We calculate the average price for available properties in each month.

The result is grouped by the month, providing insights into seasonal pricing trends.

These queries will help you analyze seasonal trends in property availability and pricing, allowing you to identify peak booking periods, high-demand seasons, and pricing variations throughout the year.

In this query:

We calculate the stay duration by finding the difference between the checkout_date and checkin_date using the DATEDIFF function.

We calculate the average review rating (review_rating) for each stay duration.

We use JOIN to link the Booking table with the Reviews table based on the booking_id.

The result is grouped by stay_duration, allowing you to examine how stay duration relates to average review ratings.

The query orders the results by stay_duration in ascending order.

This query will help you analyze whether guests tend to leave more positive reviews when they stay for longer periods. You can assess whether there is a correlation between the length of the stay and the average review rating, which can provide insights into guest satisfaction.

In this query:

We use the CORR function to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between price and review_rating.

We join the Listings and Reviews tables based on the listing_id to access both price and review rating data.

The result will provide the correlation coefficient, which measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between pricing and guest ratings.

A positive correlation indicates that higher prices are associated with higher ratings, while a negative correlation suggests that higher prices are associated with lower ratings. A correlation close to zero implies little to no linear relationship.

This query will help you determine whether there is a correlation between pricing and guest ratings, allowing you to assess whether guests are more likely to leave positive reviews for higher-priced listings or vice versa.
